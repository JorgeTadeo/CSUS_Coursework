                                    Mid-Term Review

Contents
    Everything covered from Module 1 to 6

Analysis of algorithm
    Asymptotic Notations 
    Best-case, average-case, worst-case
    Be able to provide time and space analysis for an given algorithm
    
Memory of a process
    What are the four sections? (code, data, heap, stack)  What does each section contain?
    Understand function call and stack-based memory allocation
    
Recursion
    Base case
    Recursive vs. iterative approach, every recursive method can be implemented iteratively
    Consider stack-based memory allocation in space analysis

Sorting Algorithms
    merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, count sort, radix sort
    Sorting algorithm implementation & applicaiton, performance analysis and comparison

Data structures 
	Binary tree
	Priority queue, complete binary tree, binary max/min heap
    Binary search tree
    Common operations for each data structure and their implementation
    Usages of data structures

Question types
    Single or Multiple choices
    Short answer
    Algorithm analysis (time and space)
    Writing algorithm for a given problem
    
Note
    The best way to prepare for the exam is to review class notes and related sections in the text book,
    and redo in-class exercises as well as homework questions.
